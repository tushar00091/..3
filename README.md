This is a P2P Dapp for fiat to/from crypto similar to what Centralized exchanges offer to their client (binance P2P,bybit P2P). The difference is that it's based on a smart contract.
For a visual representation of how this works, please refer to this whiteboard:

Challenges of such an app:

  -Making sure the crypto seller doesn't run with the crypto as soon as he receives the fiat

  -Making sure the crypto buyer doesn't lie about sending the fiat

  -Limiting such dishonnest behavior

The smart contract is not yet complete. It needs:
  
  -Moderator logic
  
  -Unit tests for moderator logic
